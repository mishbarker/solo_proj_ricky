Project Name - Playground APP

This project is meant to utilize Django, AJAX, Python, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, Bcrypt, along with some basic validations. 

My goal is to eventually include an API for a map and weather so a user who creates a game can know what the particular weather on that date would be. The map API is intended to depict where the park/location of the game would be.


This is a website that allows users to set-up times as well as join local sports games. If you're someone who has moved and needs someone to play basketball with this website allows you to set-up a time to allow for various people to join your game. If for some reason you decide not to initiate a game, you can always join someone else's and show up to the designated location specified to join their game.
